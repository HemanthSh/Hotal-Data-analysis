# **Hospitality Data Analysis: Unlocking Insights with Python**

Welcome to the Hospitality Data Analysis project! This repository showcases a comprehensive analysis of a hospitality dataset using Python's powerful Pandas library. Our primary focus is on calculating the Occupancy Rate—a critical metric in the hotel industry—along with other insights that can help optimize hotel operations and improve customer satisfaction.

## **Project Description**

### **About AtliQ Grands**
AtliQ Grands is a premier hospitality chain operating across major cities in India, including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bangalore. With over 20 years in the industry, AtliQ Grands offers a diverse portfolio of hotels such as AtliQ Seasons, AtliQ Exotica, AtliQ Bay, and AtliQ Palace. The company caters to a variety of guests through its luxury and business properties, with bookings available via multiple channels, including its own website, Makemytrip, Logstrip, Tripster, and offline methods.

### **Dataset Overview**
The dataset provided contains rich information across multiple dimensions:
- **Hotels**: Detailed data on properties, including their names, categories (Luxury, Business), and locations.
- **Rooms**: Information on different room classes (Standard, Elite, Premium, Presidential).
- **Bookings**: Data on bookings, including booking dates, check-in/check-out dates, number of guests, booking platforms, ratings, booking status, and revenue details.
- **Aggregated Bookings**: A summary of bookings by property, room, and check-in date, including room capacity and booking success rates.

### **Key Metric: Occupancy Rate**
The occupancy rate is the most crucial metric in the hotel industry, reflecting the percentage of available rooms that are occupied over a specific period. By analyzing this metric, we can gain valuable insights into hotel performance, peak booking times, and potential areas for improvement.

### **Project Objectives**
- **Analyze Booking Trends**: Understand booking patterns across different properties and room types.
- **Calculate Occupancy Rates**: Determine the occupancy rates for various properties, providing insights into hotel performance.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Evaluate revenue generated and realized from different booking platforms and room categories.
- **Platform Performance**: Compare booking success rates across different platforms to identify the most effective channels.
- **Customer Ratings**: Analyze customer feedback to understand satisfaction levels and areas for improvement.

### **Tools and Technologies Used**
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data processing and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for writing code, visualizing data, and sharing insights.


### **Dataset Structure**
- **dim_date**: Contains date-related information.
- **dim_hotels**: Contains property details, including property ID, name, category, and location.
- **dim_room**: Contains room-related details, including room ID and class.
- **fact_aggregated_bookings**: Contains aggregated booking data by property, room, and check-in date.
- **fact_bookings**: Contains detailed booking information, including booking ID, dates, number of guests, platforms, ratings, and revenue.

### **Key Insights**
- **Occupancy Rates**: Identified peak and off-peak seasons, helping the management to strategize better pricing and marketing efforts.
- **Revenue Trends**: Uncovered top-performing booking platforms and room categories.
- **Customer Ratings**: Analyzed customer ratings to understand satisfaction levels and key drivers of positive experiences.
